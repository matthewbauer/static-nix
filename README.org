* Statically-built Nix

** Building

You can build this with Nix using:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix-build
#+END_SRC

A statically built Nix binary will be available in =./result/bin/nix=.

You can also build for a specific architecture by passing the cpu name
like:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix-build -A aarch64
#+END_SRC

The resulting binary will be available at =./result/bin/nix-aarch64=.
CPUs currently supported are x86_64, aarch64, armv6l, i686.
